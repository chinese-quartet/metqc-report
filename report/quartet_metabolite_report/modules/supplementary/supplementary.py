        <p>SNR was established to characterize the ability of a platform or lab or batch, which was able to distinguish intrinsic differences among distinct biological sample groups (“signal”) from variations in technical replicates of the same sample group ("noise").</p>

        <p>Relative expression data (fold changes) were calculated for a total of three pairs of sample-to-sample comparisons (D5/D6, F7/D6 and M8/D6) among the Quartet samples. In order to improve the reliability of the reference values, metabolites that were satisfied with thresholds of p < 0.05 and detectable across the two samples in each sample pair were used.</p>
